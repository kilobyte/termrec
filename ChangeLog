0.19
* Fix build failure with gcc-10 (-fno-common).
* A bunch of minor and warning fixes.

0.18
* library API is now declared stable, ABI at soname 1.
  + include file is <tty.h> (not <vt100.h>)
  * identifier prefixes are tty_ not vt100_
* asciicast support (v1 and v2).
* .zst compression.
* fetching (and not very useful putting) via CURL.
* drop proxyrec.
* tty emulation improvements:
  + CJK full(double)width
  + combining characters
  * overstrike (\e[9m)
  * 24-bit color
  + many ANSI codes
  + store the window title
* license is now LGPL2+.

0.17
* Support for 256 colour codes.
* .xz support.
* Major portability/bit rot fixes.
* Assorted fixes.

0.16
* --append
* Protocols: tcp:// (rw), telnet:// (r), termcast:// (r).

0.15
* A total reorganization, with refactoring of most parts.
* Library.
* New utilities: termcat and termtime.
* Unix termplay is finally usable.
* Loading the data in a background thread actually works (not on win32).
* proxyrec defaults to --raw and -f ansi.
* Bugfixes in vt100 interpretation.
* New format: DosRecorder (read-only).

0.14
* Moved win32 crap to a dir on its own.
* proxyrec: IPv6 support for outgoing connections.
* If you specify a format, you need to append requested compression type
  to it (like, .nh.gz).  This allows disabling compression, before it was
  always .bz2 unless a file name was explicitly set.

0.13
* New format: RealLogs (write-only).

0.12
* termplay/win32: exporting a part of a replay.

0.11
* Fixed a race condition in termplay/win32 that often caused crashes if the
  file to replay was specified on the command line.
* Done proxyrec/unix -- it's untested on anything but Debian/unstable/i386,
  though.
* Made some preliminary code for termrec/unix.  It's still buggy.
