* win32/play: constant full-screen redraw

* win32/play: full prefetch

* win32/play: ugly cursor

* win32/rec: on Win95/98/ME, scrolling does a full screen dump

* win32/play: no way to select the plugin except for file extensions

* replay_export(): should record UTF-8ness and add an option to dump the
  initial screen

* tty: not all control sequences are supported.  It'd be nice to have a
  good subset of http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html
  implemented.

* win32/play: font selection being hidden in the window's sysmenu is
  unobvious, and can't be accessed under Wine at all.
