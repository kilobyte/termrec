Description: terminal videos/scripts recorder and player
 This package contains "termrec", a program which can record a terminal
 session and play it back.  It can handle both line-based programs and
 full-screen things that use curses or curses-like methods.
 Unlike "ttyrec", termrec can scroll back, use .gz/.bz2 files or files
 in several other tty recorder formats.

Package: libtty-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libtty0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: terminal/ttyrec library -- development
 libtty is a library for handling terminal output.  It is kind of "reverse
 curses" -- it is on the receiving end of tty data, accepting vt100 codes
 and managing a virtual terminal.  Programs which need this functionality
 include "screen"-likes, terminal emulators, things like "expect" that work
 with full-screen rather than line-based apps.
 .
 A second part of the library provides ways to read/write/edit ttyrec
 recordings, including formats similar to ttyrec.
 .
 This package contains the library headers.
